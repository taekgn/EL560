# Assignment 1A
Write a program that reads two numbers from the standard input (i.e. the keyboard),
multiplies them together and prints the results to the standard output (i.e. the screen).  
Test your program with the following pairs of numbers:
|input a|input b|
|------|------|
|a=8|b=9|
|a= 1800|b=9000|
|a=50000|b=60000|

##### You will need to select the Execute menu item each time you want to run the program.
##### Explain your results.  
### Control Structures
Of all the features of a language the control structures are one of the most important. They determine the
flexibility with which program statements can be combined to form programs and sub-programs, and thus
fundamentally affect the usability of the language. The C programming language has a wide variety of
control structures that make it possible to express many different types of control flow.
There are two basic types of control structure, those that cause alternative statements to be executed,
depending on some switch, and those that cause statements to be repeatedly executed. These structures were
described in Lecture 1 and the following assignment allows you to familiarise with their use.
# Assignment 1B
Alter the above program so that the stages outlined in Assignment 1 repeat in a loop. You
need to think carefully about how to quit the loop. Save your project in a separate
directory and with an appropriate name. Ensure that your program is well commented.
# Assignment 2
The following discounts are offered by a computer retailer for computer media. Write a
well commented program which reads in the item code and quantity required and displays
the discount level.

|Item Code|Description|1-9|10-19|20+|
|------|------|------|------|------|
|0|CD-R|3%|5%|10%|
|1|DVD+R|4%|7%|11%|

Typical input:
```
Item code: 1
Quantity required: 20
```
Typical output:
```
20 of item 1, discount is 11%
```
#### (Optionally, you can also display the description of the item as well!)
